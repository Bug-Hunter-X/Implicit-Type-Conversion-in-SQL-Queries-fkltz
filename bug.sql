In SQL, a common yet easily overlooked error is implicit type conversion.  Consider this example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = '10';
```

If the `price` column is an integer, comparing it to a string ('10') will lead to unexpected results, as SQL might perform an implicit conversion that's not what you intend.  Depending on the database system, this could lead to incorrect filtering or even unexpected data type errors. This is subtle because it doesn't always throw an explicit error.
